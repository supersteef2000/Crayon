### I won't be finishing this

Due to limitations in JavaFX I can't figure out a way to solve some problems I am facing, so instead I'll be rewriting this using something else.

This is the third GUI library I have tried out, and I have yet to find one that does everything I need it to do.

Don't do frontend, kids.

Have fun creating Jackson Pollock paintings.
